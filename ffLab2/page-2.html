                <p class="tm-p-mb">
                  I’m Patrick Rosales and I’m 19 years old and, I live at Merville, Pasay City. During the first year of my Senior High, I’m not used in going somewhere alone, so I am nervous because it will be my first time travelling/commuting alone going to Asia Pacific College, so I think I can say that the nervousness I felt is an indicator that I kind of traveled by myself to place I can consider new for me. After staying in APC during my senior high school days, My friends and I, had a summer outing by ourselves, it was my first time going on a beach without my family, I was scared because we commuted by just following direction we found on the internet so I was nervous the whole time because I think that we might get lost, but fortunately, we didn’t, so for me I think that I had an unexpected adventure with my friends because I was able to do the things that I’m not used to. 

                  My freshman year did go smoothly since I had credited subjects, so my subject load wasn’t that big and since the first year was more on general subjects, i had an idea since i took senior high here, so i was able to do advanced readings. I was able to relax and have fun with my friends. I spent my summer at home, playing games, eating, and sleeping, so I think that is enough for me because I prefer to maximize the vacation by relaxing at home, some would say that my summer is boring, but I am satisfied with what I’ve done the whole summer. Some would define summer vacation, as travelling, but I say that would depend in the person. Since I usually try to avoid asking money from my parents, i would only accept invitations if I have any spare money. The feelings I felt when I experienced those things I’ve mentioned are: nervousness and happiness, Since I usually have a good time with my friends, and we’ve been together for years, I am usually happy with them. I can say that I’m an optimist person, so sad/depressing things rarely affects me. 

                  I expect this class to be fun because this includes designing which is one of my interests, I also expect this class to be also hard because this subject is I think is a fundamental part of my course as BSIT-MI since designing would be a vital part of making a program.

                <hr class="tm-hr-mb" />
                <p class="tm-p-mb">
                   My most used application as of now is Netflix. This application sorts the series or movies depending on their genres.  I usually spend my time watching any series that I find interesting while I’m going through the app. I liked it because it offers a wide variety of series or movies that I can watch. And the thing I most liked about this is that it doesn’t have an advertisement that pop ups out of nowhere unlike other video streaming apps, so I can watch smoothly without any interruptions. I can also download contents on my phone so I can watch it anywhere and since I usually get stuck on traffic I can watch it so I won’t get bored while I’m waiting It also has a feature that when you’re after watching a certain series or movies, it will show a related content that might make the user to watch more. The price for this is 550 pesos for premium subscription. I can say that the price is justified by basing from the contents it offers and you’re just required to pay monthly and you can share one account with up to 4 people so that you can divide the price, so you can fully take advantage of the price. The only thing that I find disappointing is that Netflix offers different contents depending on the country so some movies or series might not be available here, but it is available on other country due to licensing deals but this is the only thing that I dislike about the whole app.

                <hr class="tm-hr-mb" />
                <p class="tm-p-mb">

                  Designing an elevator which can go as high as 1000 floor is hard, by taking capacity, speed, reliability, into factor can be hard, but since this is just theoretically, I designed an elevator which can cater up to 70 people each trip. I divided 1000 floors into 4 elevators. First elevator is from 1st to 250th, next is 250th to 500th, then 500th to 750th and lastly from 750th to 1000th floor.  My designed elevator is operated by keycard for security, accessing the elevator and for observing the capacity of the elevator. For example, a person used their keycard to operate the elevator a capacity counter will count each keycard used in operating the elevator. The elevator also has a weight counter, because the capacity of the elevator isn’t exactly considering the persons: weight, and items they’re with. So even the capacity states that the capacity hasn’t reached 70 yet, but the weight counter determined that the elevator reached its limit, the keycard reader won’t accept any keycards anymore. The interface consists of numbers for inputting the desired floor, the screen also indicates which floors the certain elevator can go up to. When the users have done entering their desired floor, a pop up will show asking if the number input is correct to avoid the elevator to stop at wrong floors and can waste time. 
                  On the inside, the keycard reader is gone, the interface shows the current floor, the next floor stop, open and close buttons, and emergency button. Since 250 floors can take a long time, I put a music feature to entertain the users. There is also a screen which indicates the song that currently plays, and next songs to be played. The elevator itself will be divide into four spaces.  There will be a certain spot in which the users should be. For example, I used the elevator to go to 245th floor, there will be a spot for me that I should go. Let’s consider it as Spot 4. Spot 4 are for the persons who will go from 186th to 250th floor. Spot 1 for 1st to 65th floor, Spot 2 is for 65th to 129th floor and spot 3 is for 129th to 193th floor. This can remove the problem for the users when they’re about to go outside. Given the usual problem in a common elevator in which the person who’s about to go outside the elevator, is on the furthest from the entrance, this will take time and inconvenience to all of them. By implementing this, it will make the process smooth.

                  <b> <em>Problem: </em></b>
                 
                 <li>Students doesn’t keep track on their absences and tardiness. </li>
                 <li> Inaccuracy in recording the attendance as per the student’s point of view.</li>
                  <li>Some students tend to record/sign other students’ attendance even though they are not physically present.</li>

                <b> <em>Needs:</em></b>
                 <li> Accurate recording of attendance (absences & tardiness)
                  <li>Attendance has a huge effect in student’s grade. Some subjects require attendance as 50% of student’s grade.</li>
                  <li>Fair attendance records for those students who came in class on time.</li>

                <b> <em>Solution:</em></b>
                  <li>Create a mobile and web application for teacher’s that will scan the RFID provided in the student’s ID.</li>
                  <li>The application will monitor the student’s attendance.</li>
                   <li>The scanner will display the time in and time out of the students.</li>
                 <li> Data will be stored in a cloud storage that can be viewed by students in the web application and can be managed by the teachers. </li>
